## 7.10.0 (2025-01-23)

**üö® New GPG Release Signing Key**

Since January 2025, we switched the GPG Key we use for signing releases in Maven Central to be
[A0B5CA1A4E086838](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2EFA55D0785C31F956F2F87EA0B5CA1A4E086838&fingerprint=on&op=index).
The full fingerprint is `2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2  F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838`.

**üöÄ New Git default branch - "main"**

We are joining the Git community and updating "master" to "main". Using the term "master" for the main
development branch can be offensive to some people. Existing versions of Git have been always capable of
working with any branch name and since 2.28.0 (July 2020) the default initial branch is configurable
(`init.defaultBranch`). Since October 2020, the default branch for new repositories on GitHub
is "main". Finally, PMD will also use this new name for the main branch in all our own repositories.

## 7.2.0

**Merged pull requests:**

* [#85](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/pull/85) Properly stringify collection attributes as sequences by [@jsotuyod](https://github.com/jsotuyod)

See https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/milestone/15

## 7.0.0

* **Bump required pmd-core version to 7.0.0.**

**Changed maven GAV**
The maven coordinates (GAV) have been changed. The artifactId has been renamed to pmd-designer.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
  <artifactId>pmd-designer</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

At the same time, the release artefact name changed to **pmd-designer-7.0.0.jar**.

**Changed default OpenJFX version to be 17**

The designer is built now against openjfx 17. When using the designer with OpenJDK, at least Java 11
is required with openjfx 17 or later.

The designer can still be started with Oracle's Java 8, which includes JavaFX. But this is not
explicitly tested.

**Fixed issues:**

* [#54](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/issues/54) Upgrade openjfx to 17
* [#65](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/issues/65) Rename artifactId to pmd-designer

* Fix some internal issues
  * Version stamping not working

See https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/milestone/7

## 6.17.0

![testing-designer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24524930/61461094-504a7900-a970-11e9-822e-30cc121b568c.gif)


## 6.16.0

* Added the possibility to search the treeview. Press CTRL+F when it's focused, or click on the `Search` :mag_right: button and enter a search query. You can cycle through results with `CTRL+TAB` or `CTRL+F3`, and cycle back with `CTRL+SHIFT+TAB` or `CTRL+SHIFT+F3`.

![TreeView search demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24524930/58752348-a3926600-84ad-11e9-9ef2-11920590b5e5.gif)

* Fix some bugs with XPath autocompletion

## 6.14.0

* Added the possibility to select a node directly from the code area.
To use this, hold the CTRL key pressed for a second. The code area should
change colors. In that state, hovering above some text should select the
node to which it corresponds:


![Node selection demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24524930/53699223-3c014780-3de6-11e9-9c6b-b9382a3c1117.gif)

* Added a crumb bar that displays the ancestors of the currently selected node.

* When you have selected a node and start editing the code again, your selection
should be preserved in most cases (on a best-effort basis) instead of reset.

* Improved the XPath export wizard

* Allow multiple independent xpath editors
